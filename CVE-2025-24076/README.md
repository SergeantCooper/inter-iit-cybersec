I was not able to fully exploit the vulnerability, I just managed to hijack the dll one or two times using the race condition mentioned on [this](https://blog.compass-security.com/2025/04/3-milliseconds-to-admin-mastering-dll-hijacking-and-hooking-to-win-the-race-cve-2025-24076-and-cve-2025-24994/) blog post using the following [script](https://github.com/mbanyamer/CVE-2025-24076/blob/main/exploit-CVE-2025-24076.py) but it didn't grant any system privileges on my vm and the malicious dll got replaced automatically by the original one after some time after the hijacking.
